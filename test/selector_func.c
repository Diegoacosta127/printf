 * Here we need to write a function that selects which function to call.

 * CASES:
 *  1. if the format is c, the function should call a function that prints a single character.
 *  2. If format is s, a function that prints string should be called.
 *  3. The % case has been handled in main function already.
 *  4. d
 *  5. i
